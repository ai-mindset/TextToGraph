David stared at the blinking cursor on his screen, the deadline for his novel looming just hours away. His concentration broke when Elena knocked on his door, bringing a thermos of coffee and her characteristic determined smile. As his editor, she knew exactly when to intervene. She sat across from him at his cluttered desk, patiently helping him untangle the plot problems that had paralyzed his writing for weeks. They worked until sunset, her analytical mind complementing his creative instincts perfectly. When she finally left, David returned to his manuscript with renewed clarity, the story flowing effortlessly now. He knew the acknowledgments page would prominently feature her nameâ€”the person who always believed in his work even when his own faith faltered.
