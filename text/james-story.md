James paced nervously outside the Dean's office, rehearsing his arguments for the campus sustainability initiative that had consumed his thoughts for weeks. The petition in his hands had nearly three hundred signatures, but he knew Dean Wallace was notoriously resistant to student-led policy changes. When the door finally opened, he was surprised to see Dr. Reyes, the environmental science professor, emerging with a satisfied smile. "Perfect timing, James," she said warmly. "I've just been discussing your proposal with the Dean. Your research on campus carbon footprint reduction is impressive—I've offered to formally sponsor your initiative." James felt a wave of relief and gratitude wash over him; Dr. Reyes had been his academic idol since sophomore year, and her support was invaluable. Her mentorship had shaped his academic path, and now she was championing his cause when it mattered most.

After his meeting, James hurried to the campus coffee shop where his childhood friend and current political rival, Thomas, was waiting. Despite their opposing positions on the student council, their friendship had endured years of heated debates. "So, did Wallace shoot you down?" Thomas asked with a smirk as James approached. James couldn't help but grin as he slid into the chair. "Actually, I've got Dr. Reyes on board. And I'm meeting with that brilliant environmental engineering student—Sofia—tomorrow to combine our petitions." Thomas raised an eyebrow, genuinely impressed. "Sofia Zhang? She's intensely dedicated—good ally to have." James nodded, already thinking ahead to their meeting. He had seen Sofia speak at a climate rally and had been struck by her passion and intelligence. As he sipped his coffee, he made a mental note to ask Marcus, his lab partner from chemistry, for more insights about Sofia's work. Marcus, being a TA in the physics department, seemed to know everyone in the science building and could provide valuable context for tomorrow's collaboration.
