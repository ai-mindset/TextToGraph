Sarah woke to the sound of rain tapping against her window, a gentle reminder that autumn had finally arrived. She hurried through her morning routine, nearly forgetting her umbrella before dashing out the door. At the café, she bumped into Marcus, her old college roommate's brother, who was in town for a conference. They shared a quiet table by the window, reminiscing about mutual friends and discovering they both worked in environmental science now. Marcus offered her a position at his research firm, explaining they needed someone with her expertise in marine ecology. Sarah left the café with his business card tucked carefully in her pocket, wondering if this chance encounter might change the course of her career.
